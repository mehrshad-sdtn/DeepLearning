# DeepLearning
codes for deep learning specialization course (on Coursera) and other my deep learning codes and projects

#### Codes and notebooks for Deep Learning Specialization course
#### Neural Networks implementations
In this directory of the repository I try to implement and explore different Neural Networks, including:
##### Standard [Artificial Neural Network](https://github.com/mehrshad-sdtn/DeepLearning/blob/master/NeuralNets/NN/ANN.ipynb)
This implementation is a fully connected Multilayer Perceptron with arbitrary architecture, number of layers and hidden units in each layer could be given to it, and it's not restricted to any number of layers or units.
