# DeepLearning
codes for deep learning specialization course (on Coursera) and other my deep learning codes and projects

#### Codes and notebooks for Deep Learning Specialization course
#### Neural Networks implementations
In this directory of the repository I try to implement and explore different Neural Networks, including:
##### Standard [Artificial Neural Network](https://github.com/mehrshad-sdtn/DeepLearning/blob/master/NeuralNets/NN/ANN.ipynb)
This implementation is a fully connected MultiLayer Perceptron with arbitrary architecture, number of layers and hidden units in each layer could be given to it as a list, and it's not restricted to any number of layers or units.
